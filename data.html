      <p>This section will provide links to the sources of the data and a description of what each of the data sets provide to the project.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Population Data:</b> the population data was sourced from the 2011 National Census which is available through the Central Statistics Office of Ireland's webpage. The population is used in this project to visualize where the vast majority of the population lives and to see if hospitals and ambulance stations are located accordingly. It is also interesting to examine the population demographics of the country as this will tell us if our population is ageing and if we will need more ambulance stations and hospitals over the coming years.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Hospitals Data:</b> this data was sourced from the Health Service Executive (HSE) and also from Google maps. The locations of the hospitals in GPS co-ordinates was needed to map the hospitals to their location within Ireland. This data was used to examine the locations of the hospitals and also the proximity of the hospitals to ambulance stations across the country. This helped us to analyse the efficiency of the Ambulance Service across the island of Ireland.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Ambulance Stations Data:</b> this data was again sourced from the HSE and Google maps was used for the GPS co-ordinates of the stations. There are 3 types of stations in the data, Ambulance stations, RRV which are Rapid Response Stations and MB which are Motorbike Stations. The data was used to see if the locations of Irelands Ambulance stations are optimally located to best serve the Irish population.</p>
