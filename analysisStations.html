      <p>This section presents a map of Ireland with the locations of the identified Ambulance stations plotted on it. It is clear from the map that the locations of large groups of Ambulance Stations correspond to areas with high densities of population. This makes perfect sense that the service is provided so as to be accesible to the vast proportion of the population. However, our investigation is to assess even those living away from the highly populated areas, are they also so lucky?</p>
