  <br>
  <p align="center">Welcome to our website for our entry to the BT Young Scientist Competition 2015</p>
  <br>
  <p align="center">Our project looks at the existing Ambulance Services Network across Ireland and examines it to see if it adressing the needs of the Irish population. We have examined the locations of both ambulance stations and hospitals with respect to the population densities across Ireland. We have also used several mathematical techniques to anlayse and find the optimal locations for ambulance stations, we did not do this for hospitals as it is impractical to move such large facilities to new locations for minor improvement in service.</p>

  <p align="center">This webpage is broken into several parts as follows:</p>
  <ul>   
      <li><b>Home page:</b> This is the page you are reading right now and acts solely as a landing page for this project, giving a brief outline of what our 2015 BT Young Scientist Project is about.</li>
      <li><b>Overview page:</b> This pages introduces the research questions of interest to us throughout this project. It defines the problem which currently exists in the Irish Ambulance Service and suggests how we are proposing to use mathematical methods to solve this issue.</li>
      <li><b>Data page:</b> gives you a view of the data used in this project. It also outlines the use of the data and from where it was sourced. We have also included a download link for the data used as .csv files for anyone that wishes to reuse the data.</li>
      <li><b>Analysis page:</b> The analysis page is where the vast majority of our work is outlined. It includes all the analysis completed throughout this project, including the analysis of hospital and ambulance stations locations, census data analysis and also an outline of the mathematical methods used.</li>
      <li><b>About Us page:</b> This gives a brief background on the authors of this project.</li>
      <li><b>Contact Us page:</b> Feedback is one way that mistakes can be spotted and ideas can be suggested, so if you have here please fill up the form and let us know.</li>
