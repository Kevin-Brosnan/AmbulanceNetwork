      <p>In our entire data set we have 132 hospitals and 92 Ambulance Stations across the country. However, the vast majority of the hospitals in our data do not provide a 24 hour Accident and Emergency Service, thus not allowing access for Ambulances to the hospital constantly. Also, this project's interest has always been focused on the analysis of the Irish Medical Emergency service in hard to reach places, Dublin contains 45 hospitals and a multitude of the Irish Ambulance Stations, thus we will not analyse Dublin in this analysis as the facilities are in place. For this reason our hospital list has been reduced down to the following:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
         <li>Cork University Hospital</li>
         <li>Letterkenny General Hospital, Letterkenny, Co. Donegal</li>
         <li>Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway</li>
         <li>Naas General Hospital, Naas, Co. Kildare</li>
         <li>St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny</li>
         <li>Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise</li>
         <li>University Hospital Limerick</li>
         <li>Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar</li>
         <li>Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, Co. Offaly</li>
         <li>Sligo General Hospital</li>
         <li>Waterford Regional Hospital</li>
         <li>Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath</li>
         <li>Wexford General Hospital</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>While limiting the number of hospitals down to those in the list above reduces the total number of distances to calculate from 12,144 to 1,196, the time to calculate each of these by hand would be considerable. For this we have used a programming language called <em>R</em>, which is used extensively for statistical and mathematical analysis projects.</p>
