      <p>A study carried out in the UK in 2007, titled <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2464671/" style="color = 'black'">"The relationship between distance to hospital and patient mortality in emergencies: an observational study"</a> found that an increase of travel distance of 10km from patient to hospital increased mortality rate of said patient by 1%, in particular for patients with respiratory conditions. While a 1% increase may seem irrelevant this increase with every 10km could be significant to an already severely ill patient. While the distance from the location of the patient to the hospital is the length of time we wish to minimise we also need to be aware of the time it takes the ambulance to get from the Ambulance Station to the patients location. As these locations are unknown without real data, to which we have no access, we assume that in general the ambulance picks up a patient while travelling towards the nearest hospital. Thus Ambulances located at hospitals will have a travel distance of 0km but simply because we are making this overlying assumption.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the UK report shown above it was stated that journeys of less than 10km were short journeys, medium journeys were classes between 10-20km and long journeys were anything over 20km. Below is a table of the distances between hospitals and ambulance stations, distances of greater than 75km have been set to zero as a distance this long will not save lives.</p>
