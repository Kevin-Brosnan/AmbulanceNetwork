      <p>From the above barchart it can be clearly seen that the location of our Ambulance Service Stations is not optimal with respect to the Emergency Services in Ireland. For the vast majority of hospitals with full A&E hours the Ambulance Stations are located more than 40km from the nearest hospital, this is a straight line distance from Ambulance Station to Hospital, a road may not exist in such a fashion. However, looking back at the map of locations of the Ambulance Service Stations they appear to be evenly distributed across the country allowing access to even the most remote locations in the Island of Ireland. In essence, it appears that the location of the Ambulance Service Stations is not the issue in Ireland but rather it is the location of 24 hour Accident and Emergency Services. While the relocation of Emergency departments is not feasible the reopening of recently closed services should be a priority for the current Health Service Executive Committee.</p>

      <p>While we set out in this project to discover inadequacies in the location and service provided by the Irish Ambulance Service, it appears that out intuition on this basis was wrong and mis-guided. The prime-time investigations and media allegations against the Irish Ambulance Service are wrong and the HSE shutting down A&E Departments across the country is at fault.</p>
