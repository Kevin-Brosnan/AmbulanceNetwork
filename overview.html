   <font face="century gothic"><h3 style="color:red;">Why are we trying to solve it?</h3></font>
   <p>During the summer of 2014 there were a lot of reports in national press and a Prime Time Report of the state of the ambulance service in Ireland. Despite numerous changes in the Health Service and the abolition of Health Boards and the closure of hospitals with rationalisation of services, more and more stories of ambulances not reaching their patients on time emerged despite the Government allocating more resources. This project using a combination of Graph Theory and census data aims to discover if our ambulances are located in the optimal locations to serve Ireland's ageing population.

   <font face="century gothic"><h3 style="color:red;">How will we solve it?</h3></font>
   <p>Throughout this project we intend to use basic graph theory methods to analyse the current positions of the ambulance stations located throughout the island of Ireland. We will investigate the locations of these stations in relation to several key factors, including the proximity to the nearest hospital and also the proximity to the areas of most need throughout Ireland. Data will be collected from sources including the 2011 Census, the HSE and data from the National Ambulance Service. Finally, graph theory will again be used to find the correct locations for ambulance stations in Ireland.

   <font face="century gothic"><h3 style="color:red;">What have we done so far?</h3></font>
   <p>To date we have carried out extensive research into the current problems experienced in Ireland with the "mis-location" of many of the Ambulance Stations. We have found that on several cases in the past 12 months several ambulances have not been within a distance of patients to allow paramedics to save lives. We have also found that these ambulance stations can be significant distances from hospitals with full A&E hours. The data has been analysed and the results collected. Now we are carrying out last-minute preperations for the BT Young Scientist Competition in January.
