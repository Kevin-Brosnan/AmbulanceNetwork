      <p>From the above data table the average distance from hospitals to Ambulance Stations is a staggering 146.6965km. However it is impractical to use this distance as a guideline to the distance of the hospitals from Ambulance Stations in Ireland. What is more appropriate is to see the Ambulance Stations which are closest to each hospital and scale them on a basis of short, medium and long journey lengths. From this table we will be able to understand in more detail the severity of the problems in the Irish Ambulance Service.</p>
