      <p>While we have carried out extensive work throughout this project there are some aspects which still remain to be addressed. The vast majority of what remains was not carried out due to lack of data, mathematical knowledge and time. The below list gives an idea of the scope that this project could take in the future.</p>
      <br>
      <ol>
         <li>Analyse the locations of households across Ireland and complete an in depth analysis of distances from households to nearest hospital with full A&E hours</li>
         <li>Carry out the analysis for day and night separately given that many hospitals currently provide an A&E service with reduced hours</li>
         <li>Calculate the distances as the "road distance" traveled by an Ambulance from incident location to hospital rather than a straight line distance between points</li>
         <li>Carry out the analysis on a hospital by hospital basis as the problem may be isolated to certain areas</li>
         <li>We have assumed that all the Health Boards across Ireland will work together however this is currenlty not the case and Health Board boundaries often cause disputes when ambulances are dispatched.</li>
