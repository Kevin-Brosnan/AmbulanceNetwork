      <br>
      <p>So far in our project we have examined each piece of the collected data individually. We have looked at the population data from the census report, the hospital data available online and the ambulance stations data available through the Health Service Executive. This section looks to accumulate all of the existing data sources and analyse it to assess the existing Medical Emergency Service in Ireland</p>
      <br>
      <p>The first step in the analysis was to calculate the distance between each hospital and each ambulance station across the country. The data we recorded for the locations of the hospitals and ambulance stations earlier in our analysis were in the form of latitude and longitude, however distance is calculated in kilometers and so we needed to transfer from GPS distance to kilometers.</p>
      <p>The most common way to transfer between a GPS distance and a distance in kilometers is using the <em>Great Circle Distance Algorithm.</em> This method developed calculates the shortest distance between two points on the Earths surface, allowing for the complexity of the curvature of that surface. The formula required for calculation of the Great Circle Distance, where R is the mean radius of the earth and is equal to 6,371km, is given below;</p>
