      <br>
      <p>A National Census of Ireland was carried out in 2011 with the data now being publicly available online from the Central Statistics Office. In this section we have examined the population of the 26 counties in the Republic of Ireland recorded on the night of the 2011 census.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To examine this data we have developed several bar plots which can be interacted with by choosing the options in the left sidebar. It is possibly to produce the bar plot of the population per county, age group and gender for the entire country. It is also possible to produce a stacked bar plot of two of the variables. The first variable chosen becomes the bars themselves but the second variable splits the bars into sections based on the value within each group of the second variable.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To examine this data in more detail or to understand the data we have used please visit the Data page where you can also download a .csv file of the data.</p>
